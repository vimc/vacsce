# vacsce
R package for vaccine scenario generation. vacsce stands for vaccination scenarios. It provides a set of coverage projection rules.

## Objectives
The initial objective was to document commonly used coverage projection rules and work as a tool for VIMC's model runs, interim-update and related analysis. As VIMC continues expanding its collaboration with greater public health community, we further release vacsce as a package for external users who share common interests such as planning for immunization programs, assessment of vaccine impact, etc.
